# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Analyze ride-share data provided by PyBer and provide insights to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability.

Results:



There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
Underserved neighborhoods the fares are .
The correlation between the drivers force, the number of rides and the average fare price is not clear so additional analysis including geographic size, travel distances, cellphone coverage would be needed to get a clearer picture.
Suburban drivers were only about 17% of the total drivers but accounted for more than 30% of the total fares and just above a quarter of the rides.
Improving access to PyBer service in those areas will imply finding the right balance between incentives for more riders to join in and the right fare charge that will motivates riders to pick PyBer app as the first choice for their travels.
Additional analysis including geographic size, population and social conditions, travel distances would be interesting to dive in.
The general tendencies is high number of drivers and rides goes with medium to low fare.
On the scatter plot, we notice some urban cities with low number of drivers and low average fare but pretty high count of rides. Analyzing the average number of drivers against the population and infrastructure and economic activity in those cities would help understand those disparities.
