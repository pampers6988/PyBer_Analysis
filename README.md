Recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

Though the demand is not as high in Rural cities as in Urban and Suburban cities due inmost part to population disparities and distance, it is important to identify the trends to help drive the cost down to increase business in the Rural cities. Increase the number of drivers available in rural cities in late Feburary to the beginning of April. Providing greater access to ride-sharing during this time may  lead to a decrease the average fare per ride.

Suburban and Urban cities are more densly populatred and the service areas are not as large as in rural cities. However, it is still important to increase and decrease access as demand ebbs and wanes throught the year.

1.Increase the number of drivers available in suburban cities in late February and scale back in March to early April and increase again mid April.This is driving by the demand for ride-sharing at peak times thoughout the year.

2. Increase the number of drivers available in urban cities in early February as the demand begins to increase and scale back mid April as the demand decrease.
